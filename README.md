clone the repo first for the backend inside the main branch, and for the front-end inside the test branch
open both frontend and backend and type npm install to install all the dependencies
npm start/node app.js to run both
backend uses port 3001, while the frontend uses 3000 port
you can register for a new account, but there is default account that I use { username:test1 password:12345678 }
